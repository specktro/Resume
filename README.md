# Specktro's Resume Application

This is a simple application to show the specktro's resume as a table view with coordinators architecture (I used just one coordinator for this example).

## Summary
The application use a flow coordinators architecture to separate the view and the logic, it was created a singleton to get the information’s network and the structures used as models are Codable types.

## Instructions
Just clone it and have fun!
